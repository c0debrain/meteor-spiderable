# spiderable
Revival fork of [https://github.com/meteor/meteor/packages/deprecated/spiderable](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/packages/deprecated/spiderable)

Meteor v1.6+ only (as of expected lack of time for legacy testing)
Uses `phantomjs-prebuilt@2.1.16` so you don't need to install or build phantomjs on the server
and "npm native" `phantom.exec()` instead of the earlier `bash -c exec` and `stdin` hack
> At the moment this means your build will increase by about 64MB (sad ya. see todo :P)


## Install
Add the meteor package
```js
meteor add nooitaf:spiderable
```

Add the npm package from `phantomjs-prebuilt` to your project `>=v2.1.16`
```js
meteor npm install phantomjs-prebuilt --save
```

You can use the `SPIDERABLE_URL` environment variable to overwrite the absolute url
```bash
export SPIDERABLE_URL="http://localhost:4000"
```

## About
`spiderable` is part of [Webapp](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/master/packages/webapp). It's one possible way to allow web search engines to index a Meteor application. It uses the [AJAX Crawling specification](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/) published by Google to serve HTML to compatible spiders (Google, Bing, Yandex, and more).

When a spider requests an HTML snapshot of a page the Meteor server runs the client half of the application inside [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/), a headless browser, and returns the full HTML generated by the client code.

In order to have links between multiple pages on a site visible to spiders, apps must use real links (eg `<a href="/about">`) rather than simply re-rendering portions of the page when an element is clicked. Apps should render their content based on the URL of the page and can use [HTML5 pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history) to alter the URL on the client without triggering a page reload. See the [Todos example](http://meteor.com/examples/todos) for a demonstration.

When running your page, `spiderable` will wait for all publications to be ready. Make sure that all of your [`publish functions`](#meteor_publish) either return a cursor (or an array of cursors), or eventually call [`this.ready()`](#publish_ready). Otherwise, the `phantomjs` executions will fail.

## Notes
If you deploy your application with `meteor bundle`, you must install `phantomjs` ([http://phantomjs.org](http://phantomjs.org/)) somewhere in your `$PATH`. If you use `meteor deploy` this is already taken care of.

Don't forget to use the same `node` version on you production server as stated in the `README.md` inside your meteor bundle. At the time of writing it's `meteor@1.6.0` combined with `node@8.8.1`.

## Todo
- any meteor settings, ports and such
- maybe get rid of 64MB (omg!) binary in meteor build
